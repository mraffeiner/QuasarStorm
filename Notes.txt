=====    Quasar Storm    =====

TODO:

Core:
- Main Menu (Play, Settings)
- Settings (Master Volume, Quality Presets)

Features:
- Customize bullets while playing

Polish:
- VFX
- Audio
- Projectile distance should be relative to player velocity (flying faster makes projectile range feel shorter)
- Add id to database objects
- Fix physics stutter

Skills:
- ScriptableObject-Architecture: Dynamic elements are implemented with ScriptableObjects, making it possible to easily change their properties during runtime (through both inspector and player input)
- Object Pooling: nothing is destroyed, everything is reused as needed (eg. Projectiles get deactivated instead of destroyed, then redecorated and reactivated)
- Event-Driven: Only UI elements and player input use Update() / FixedUpdate(), everything else is controlled through events
- Custom Update Coroutines (regular checks like simulation distance use separate coroutines with custom intervals instead of running their code every frame)
